# Hi there, I'm Sue ðŸ‘‹ 

I love programming but have relatively little to do with it in my current job.
So I'm teaching myself how to build apps in my spare time.

Later, I would like to develop useful apps that can make life easier for people with visual impairments or other special needs.

I'm just getting started. Let's see where the journey takes me.... ðŸ˜Š
