# Hi there, I'm Sue ðŸ‘‹ 

with some basic programming skills, even more enthusiasm for learning new things 
and a bunch of crazy ideas, I'm trying to develop my first useful android app. 
Later I would like to develop apps that can make life a bit easier for people with visual impairments or other special needs.

I'm just getting started. Let's see where the journey takes me... ðŸ˜Š
